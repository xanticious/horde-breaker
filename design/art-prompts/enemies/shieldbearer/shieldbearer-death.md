## Primary Prompt (DALL-E 3 / Stable Diffusion 3)

```
Full body character sprite for a 2D side-scrolling action game. A stocky Scottish Highland
shieldbearer warrior in his final death collapse — fallen and at rest, facing right. He has
fallen to the ground, body heavy on the moorland. His large targe shield has fallen beside
him or he clutches it weakly. The broadsword is on the ground near his hand. His stocky
build is apparent even in death — a heavy, solid frame completely at rest. Eyes closed,
the defensive intensity of his life extinguished. Not grotesque — a strong warrior fallen.
Chainmail and leather, iron helm if present is beside him or askew. Fallen body occupies
the lower portion of the 240×384 frame, horizontal. Photorealistic high-definition
digital painting, God of War 2022 quality, 2D game sprite, 240×384 px. Transparent background.
Character/body faces right. Cold iron and leather palette.

## Animation Notes

- **Frame count target:** 12–16 frames
- **Loop:** No — plays once, **freezes on the final frame**
- **Animation phases:**
  1. **Fatal hit break** (frames 0–4): The blow that finally brings him down — shield knocked wide, body failing.
  2. **Heavy fall** (frames 5–10): Goes down hard — a heavier fall than the swordsman, more weight and mass. The shield hits separately.
  3. **Final rest** (frames 11–15): PRIMARY PROMPT — at rest on the ground. **Frame is held.**
- **Weight:** His death fall should be the heaviest of the Ch.1 enemies — emphasize mass and finality.

## Technical Reminders

- Character **faces RIGHT** when fallen
- Fallen body is **horizontal** in the lower portion of the 240 × 384 frame
