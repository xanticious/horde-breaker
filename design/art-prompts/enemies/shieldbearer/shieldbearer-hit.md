## Primary Prompt (DALL-E 3 / Stable Diffusion 3)

```
Full body character sprite for a 2D side-scrolling action game. A stocky Scottish Highland
shieldbearer warrior reacting to taking a hit that got through his guard — staggered and hurt,
facing right. The blow landed despite the shield — perhaps at his sword-side, or the shield
was knocked back into him. His body rocks backward from the impact, the shield jolted off-line,
face grimacing with pain and shock. He is more resistant-looking than the swordsman even in
his hit react — stocky and planted, the stagger is shorter and he recovers his shield quickly.
Weight shifted back, but stance less broken than a lighter enemy. Shield may be knocked to
an awkward angle. Photorealistic high-definition digital painting, God of War 2022 quality,
2D game sprite, full body, feet at bottom edge, 240×384 px. Transparent background.
Character faces right. Cold iron and leather palette.

## Animation Notes

- **Frame count target:** 4–6 frames
- **Loop:** No — plays once, returns to idle
- **Key distinction:** The shieldbearer's hit react should look MORE resilient than the swordsman's — he's a tank. Less dramatic stagger, quicker recovery. His shield snapping back to guard position is the visual recovery cue.

## Technical Reminders

- Character **faces RIGHT**
- **Feet at bottom edge**
