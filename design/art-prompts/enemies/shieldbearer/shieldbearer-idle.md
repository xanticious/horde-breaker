## Primary Prompt (DALL-E 3 / Stable Diffusion 3)

```
Full body character sprite for a 2D side-scrolling action game. A stocky, heavily defensive
Scottish Highland shieldbearer warrior in an alert on-guard idle stance, facing right. He is
shorter and wider than the hero — solid, wall-like, immovable-looking. His LEFT arm bears a
large round Scottish targe shield — wooden and iron-bossed, with clan markings burned or
carved into the face, slightly worn. The targe is held forward at chest/chin height,
covering his body. His RIGHT hand holds a one-handed broadsword at his side, ready to swing.
He wears more armor than the standard swordsman — chainmail or scale over leather, iron
pauldrons, leather trousers. He may wear a simple iron helm or go bare-headed. Expression:
immovable, patient, waiting. The shield is the dominant visual element — large, forward-facing.
Photorealistic high-definition digital painting, God of War 2022 quality, 2D game sprite,
full body, feet at bottom edge, 240×384 px portrait frame. Transparent background. Character
faces right. Muted cold palette — iron, stone grey, dark leather.

oversaturated, bright colors
```

## Animation Notes

- **Frame count target:** 10–14 frames
- **Loop:** Yes — shield lifted, breathing, alert idle cycle
- **Key visual identifier:** The round targe shield held out in front. This is what makes the shieldbearer instantly recognizable from across the screen.
- **Stance:** Compact and planted — narrower than the swordsman but more solid. Weight low and balanced.
- **Frame is portrait but narrower** than standard characters: 240 × 384 px.

## Technical Reminders

- Character **faces RIGHT** — the shield faces LEFT (toward the approaching hero)
- **Feet at bottom edge**
- The shield extends to the left of the character's body — may approach the left edge of the 240 px frame
- Export: `shieldbearer-idle-00.png` through `shieldbearer-idle-13.png`
