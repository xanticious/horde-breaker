## Primary Prompt (DALL-E 3 / Stable Diffusion 3)

```
Full body character sprite for a 2D side-scrolling action game. A lightly armored Scottish
Highland raider swordsman in his final death collapse — fallen and lying on the ground,
facing right. His body has collapsed fully: torso on the ground, limbs spread or folded
naturally, claymore lying beside him. Head down, eyes closed. His expression in death is
one of release — the fight is over. Not grotesque, no excessive blood — a defeated warrior
fallen in combat. Worn wool and leather, iron skullcap beside him or still on. The fallen
body occupies the lower portion of the 256×384 frame, now horizontal. Photorealistic
high-definition digital painting, God of War 2022 quality, 2D game sprite, 256×384 px.
Transparent background. Character/body faces right. Muted earthy palette.

multiple characters, excessive gore, blood pool, skeleton, zombie, sci-fi, magic
```

## Animation Notes

- **Frame count target:** 12–16 frames
- **Loop:** No — plays once, **freezes on the final frame**
- **Animation phases:**
  1. **Fatal reaction** (frames 0–4): Severe hit that breaks his stance — collapsing begins.
  2. **Fall** (frames 5–10): Going to the ground — knees giving way, torso hitting.
  3. **Final rest** (frames 11–15): PRIMARY PROMPT — fully settled on the ground. **Frame is held indefinitely.**

## Technical Reminders

- Character **faces RIGHT** — even fallen, head points right
- Fallen body is **horizontal** in the lower portion of the frame
