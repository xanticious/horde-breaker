## Primary Prompt (DALL-E 3 / Stable Diffusion 3)

```
Full body character sprite for a 2D side-scrolling action game. A lightly armored Scottish
Highland raider swordsman in an alert on-guard idle stance, facing right. He is an enemy —
visually subordinate to the barbarian hero but individually threatening. Build: lean to
medium, quick-looking. He holds a large two-handed Highland claymore at the ready — point
slightly lowered, both hands on the grip, weapon at a diagonal guard position. Wearing rough
wool tunic and trousers, worn brown leather vest/jerkin, simple leather boots. Minimal or no
helmet — maybe a simple iron skullcap or bare-headed. Scruffy, road-worn appearance. Hair
matted or roughly tied back. His expression: challenging, aggressive, locked on the target
to his left (the hero is to the left from his perspective). Mid-tone color scheme to contrast
with the hero's warm leather tones. Photorealistic high-definition digital painting, God of
War 2018 visual quality, 2D game sprite, full body visible, feet at bottom edge, 256×384 px.
Transparent background. Character faces right. Muted earthy palette.

## Animation Notes

- **Frame count target:** 10–14 frames
- **Loop:** Yes — on-guard breathing/weight cycle
- **Key pose:** Alert on-guard stance with claymore ready (PRIMARY PROMPT).
- **Contrast with hero:** The swordsman is leaner and less imposing than the barbarian — the hero should always read as larger and more powerful at a glance.
- **Enemy readability:** His silhouette should be immediately recognizable as "swordsman" — the two-handed claymore at a guard angle is the key visual identifier.

## Technical Reminders

- Character **faces RIGHT**
- **Feet at bottom edge**
- Export: `swordsman-idle-00.png` through `swordsman-idle-13.png`
