## Primary Prompt (DALL-E 3 / Stable Diffusion 3)

```
Full body character sprite for a 2D side-scrolling action game. A lightly armored Scottish
Highland raider swordsman reacting to taking a heavy blow — staggered and hit, facing right.
His body is rocked violently backward from the strike — weight thrown rearward, head snapped
back, one arm flung wide, claymore swung back or nearly dropped. His face shows pain and
shock — eyes wide, expression broken from the aggression of his combat stance. The hit has
clearly hurt him. He is staggered but still standing — not dead. Worn wool and leather,
simple iron skullcap or bare-headed. Photorealistic high-definition digital painting,
God of War 2022 quality, 2D game sprite, full body, feet at bottom edge, 256×384 px.
Transparent background. Character faces right. Muted earthy palette.
```

## Negative Prompt (Stable Diffusion 3 only)

```
cartoon, anime, pixel art, vector, plate armor, magic, sci-fi, facing left, background,
text, watermark, multiple characters, attacking, blocking, dead, lying down, oversaturated
```

## Animation Notes

- **Frame count target:** 4–6 frames
- **Loop:** No — plays once, returns to idle
- **Key pose:** Peak recoil/stagger — body rocked backward, maximum impact position (PRIMARY PROMPT).
- Short, snappy animation. 2 frames of impact/knockback, 2–3 frames recovering.

## Technical Reminders

- Character **faces RIGHT**
- **Feet at bottom edge** — stagger stays on the ground
