## Berserker Design Reference

The berserker is a Chapter 3 elite enemy — the big dangerous threat. He mirrors the hero in many ways: a large powerful Highland warrior who fights with savage fury rather than technique. He is larger than the swordsman and shieldbearer. He dual-wields two short axes or a pair of hand axes, or wields a single massive one-handed broadaxe with terrifying speed. His defining trait: he has RAGE. His idle already shows barely contained violence. Paint him more wild and worn than the hero — like the hero's darker reflection. Shirtless or minimal leather/fur armor showing a scarred, battle-hardened physique. Face is savage and manic.

## Idle — Primary Prompt

```
Full body character sprite for a 2D side-scrolling action game. A massive, battle-scarred
Scottish Highland berserker warrior in a seething angry idle stance, facing right. He is
bulkier and more imposing than standard enemies but slightly smaller than the hero. He barely
contains his battle-rage in idle — weight forward, arms out slightly, fists clenched or axes
held loose at his sides. He may be breathing hard, veins visible, jaw clenched. His
expression: barely restrained violence, eyes burning. He wears minimal armor: bare chest
or open rough-leather vest showing heavy musculature and battle scars, rough trousers,
studded leather bracers. War paint or clan markings on his face or chest. His weapons
(two hand axes or one massive axe) are gripped with white knuckles. This is a man who
lives for combat. Photorealistic high-definition digital painting, God of War 2022 quality,
2D game sprite, full body, feet at bottom edge, 280×400 px. Transparent background.
Character faces right. Muted but slightly warmer blood-and-iron palette than other enemies.
```

**Animation Notes:** 8–12 frames, loop yes — barely contained restless energy, shifting weight, micro-twitches of aggression

## Attack — Primary Prompt

```
Full body character sprite for a 2D side-scrolling action game. A massive Scottish Highland
berserker warrior at the peak of a frenzied dual-axe or single heavy-axe assault, facing
right. Unlike the precise techniques of other enemies, the berserker attacks with overwhelming
fury — multiple rapid hits in a spinning or flailing frenzy. Capture the peak moment:
both axes blurring in motion (or single axe at apex of savage overhead/diagonal swing),
body fully committed to the assault, face twisted in a battle roar. The attack should read
as RECKLESS AGGRESSION — more powerful but less controlled than the swordsman. Motion blur
on weapons acceptable. Bare or near-bare chest, battle scars, studded bracers. Photorealistic
high-definition digital painting, God of War 2022 quality, 2D game sprite, full body,
feet at bottom edge, 280×400 px. Transparent background. Character faces right.
```

**Animation Notes:**

- Frame count: 12–16 frames, loop no
- **Multiple hit flurry:** Unlike single-swing enemies, the berserker's attack is a rapid multi-hit. Generate the key moment of peak-fury (one arm raised with axe, one arm swinging through).
- **Wind-up:** A roaring, arms-spread moment that precedes the flurry — visually distinct, signals the incoming burst of hits.

## Additional Wind-Up Prompt (Berserker Attack)

```
Scottish Highland berserker warrior in attack wind-up / berserker rage entrance pose,
facing right. He throws his arms wide and tilts his head back in a full battle roar —
the moment of releasing his inner fury before a combat frenzy. Chest out, axes held wide.
Maximum threatening energy. This is the player's signal to dodge. Photorealistic digital
painting, transparent background, 280×400 px.
```

## Hit Reaction — Primary Prompt

```
Full body character sprite, massive Scottish Highland berserker warrior taking a hit —
but reacting with ANGER rather than pain. The blow staggers him less than it would a normal
enemy; instead of showing fear, his face shows rage doubling at being struck. Head barely
rocked, body barely flinching — a TANK who absorbs pain and becomes more dangerous.
His expression if anything is more terrifying after the hit. Photorealistic digital painting,
God of War quality, transparent background, 280×400 px. 4–6 frames, no loop.
```

---

## Death — Primary Prompt

```
Full body character sprite, massive Scottish Highland berserker warrior in his death collapse
— the hardest fall in the game, a mountain brought down. He does not fall gracefully:
a heavy, violent crash to the ground that shakes the earth. His final pose: sprawled
face-down or on his side, weapons beside him, the fury gone from his face, finally at rest.
His death should feel like a genuine achievement — he was a monster to put down.
Photorealistic digital painting, God of War quality, transparent background, 280×400 px.
16–20 frames, no loop, hold on last frame.
