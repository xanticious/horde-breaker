## Primary Prompt (DALL-E 3 / Stable Diffusion 3)

```
Full body animal sprite for a 2D side-scrolling action game. A large mangy battle-scarred
Scottish Highland wolf reacting to taking a heavy blow — a stagger/hit-react pose, facing
right. The wolf's body is rocked sideways and backward by the impact. Head jerked back and
to the side, body twisting away from the blow, paws scrambling. Eyes wide and shocked, mouth
possibly open in a pain-yelp. The hit is visible in the body language — it is clearly hurt
but not yet dead. Grey-brown scarred fur, lean dangerous build, yellow-amber eyes.
Photorealistic high-definition digital painting, God of War 2022 quality, 2D game sprite,
240×180 px landscape frame. Transparent background. Wolf faces right even in the hit react.
Muted earthy palette.

## Negative Prompt (Stable Diffusion 3 only)

watermark, multiple wolves, glowing, sci-fi, magic, dead, lying flat, friendly
```

## Animation Notes

- **Frame count target:** 4–6 frames
- **Loop:** No — plays once, returns to idle
- **Key pose:** Maximum recoil from the blow — body rocked, head jerked back (PRIMARY PROMPT).
- **Brevity:** This animation is short and snappy — a quick hit-flash and recovery. 2 frames of impact, 2–3 frames recovering.

## Technical Reminders

- Wolf **faces RIGHT**
- Paws near bottom edge even when staggering
