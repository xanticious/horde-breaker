## Primary Prompt (DALL-E 3 / Stable Diffusion 3)

```
Full body character sprite for a 2D side-scrolling action game. A lightly built Scottish
Highland archer in an alert idle stance, facing right. He is the most agile-looking of the
enemies — lighter build, quick and wiry rather than powerful. He carries a longbow in his
left hand, undrawn and held loosely at his side or resting on the ground. A quiver of arrows
is on his back. He wears minimal armor: rough wool tunic, leather bracers on his bow arm,
no heavy armor that would impede his draw. Simple boots, ranger-style attire. His eyes scan
the distance (to his right) — a ranger watching for approach. Expression: alert, calculating
the range. Slightly shorter and narrower frame than the swordsman — 220×360 px.
Photorealistic high-definition digital painting, God of War 2022 quality, 2D game sprite,
full body, feet at bottom edge. Transparent background. Character faces right. Muted
earthy palette: wool grey-brown, dark leather, wood bow.

## Animation Notes

- **Frame count target:** 10–14 frames
- **Loop:** Yes — alert scanning idle
- **Key visual identifier:** The longbow in hand, the quiver at his back. Silhouette should be immediately readable as "archer."
- **Lighter frame:** 220 px wide, 360 px tall — he is the slimmest enemy in Chapter 2.

## Technical Reminders

- Character **faces RIGHT**
- **Feet at bottom edge**
