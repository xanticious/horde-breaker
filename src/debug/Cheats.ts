/**
 * Cheats — Dev-only cheat commands.
 *
 * Placeholder stub. Populated in a later sprint when the game loop and
 * actor hierarchy are in place. Intended usage:
 *
 *   - `Cheats.maxUpgrades()` — set all upgrade levels to maximum
 *   - `Cheats.skipToChapter(n)` — jump directly to a chapter
 *   - `Cheats.setCurrency(amount)` — override the currency balance
 *
 * All exports are no-ops in production (`import.meta.env.PROD`).
